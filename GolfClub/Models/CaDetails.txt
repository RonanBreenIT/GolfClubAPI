RESTful Web Service and Client

GolfClub Ltd. are an Golf Club company that Golfservices. They need a public RESTful web service which manages data about Golfers in their Club.

The service needs to maintain the following data for a movie:

⦁	GUI– unique in the collection
⦁	First Name – not blank
⦁	Sur Name – not blank
⦁	Genres –  one of more of the following genres:
⦁	Youth, Full, Part-Time, Patron, 
⦁	Handicap – UnderTen, UnderTwenty, UnderThirty. PlusThirty
⦁	Join date – date  the Golfer Joined



The RESTful service should provide the following operations on request:

⦁	Return data about all Golfers in the catalogue, sorted by Date Joined (most recent to oldest).
⦁	Return data about a specific Golfer as specified using GUI
⦁	Return a list of Golfers and Names for Golfers that contain a specified keyword as a whole word in their title.

Use a model classes to represent Golfers. Implement appropriate validation.

Use an in-memory collection of Golfers and review data in the controller, populate with test data when the service is run.

Implement an appropriate URI addressing scheme for the service and its operations. Enable Swagger support on the service.

It is intended that the client for the forum will be mobile apps on various platforms, but for now a console application will suffice. Implement a console client application which invokes the various service operations and displays the results.


Deliverable: ZIP and upload both the service and client projects to Moodle, print out and hand up source code
